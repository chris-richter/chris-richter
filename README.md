# Chris Richter

## tldr;

I'm a web native app developer.  I build applications that deliver value across iOS, Android, desktop and web delivery strategies.

## Areas Of Interest

I love MVPs.  I love disruptive technologies.  I love projects that promote some greater good.  

## Core Skills

I don't like the term "full-stack" as I just feel it is a little narcisstic to think there aren't things over the horizon of my knowledge, but I guess I qualify as full-stack.

I have built and am comfortable getting my hands dirty on an OS for an ESP32 running micropython for an MQTT/IoT solution.  I'm extremely comfortable as we move into the PaaS or back-end and ultimately to whatever application(s) we need for the job.  

Most of my work is in an Ionic + Angular + Capacitor environment.  I can run a MEAN stack, I usually prefer to use a BaaS/PaaS with Firebase being my most common recommendation.

A common requirement is some sort of API for a modern app.  Increasingly I'm deploying this as a server-less API on Express or Flask running as a cloud function.  

With respect to native projects, I have implemented many of the tools from the Capacitor API including and not limited to components like geolocation, camera (either for uploads or for QR strategies) and items like push notifications.  

## Biggest Regrets or To-Do's

I built an end-to-end solution for water quality monitoring as an IoT solution.  We created a hardware API to control deep-level handling of the switching inside of a series of Analog Devices chips.  As I write this in 2022, let's be realistic about if we could manufacture really anything right now, but one of my biggest regrets is not carving out the time to have open-sourced this project to do good.  I figured this was more likely to hold me acccountable than a section saying I'm messing around with Go or Dart in my free time.
