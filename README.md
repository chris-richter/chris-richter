# Chris Richter

## tldr;

I'm a web native app developer.  I build applications that deliver value across iOS, Android, desktop and web delivery strategies.

## Areas Of Interest

I love MVPs.  I love disruptive technologies.  I love projects that promote some greater good.  

## Core Skills

I don't like the term "full-stack" as I just feel it is a little narcisstic to define the beginning and end of what we know as "full-stack."  We all stand on the shoulders of giants who built the tools we use to solve problems.  

I have built and am comfortable getting my hands dirty on an OS for an ESP32 running micropython for an MQTT/IoT solution.  I'm equally comfortable dealing with Apple review.  That's a pretty full-stack, but it's not like I'm launching my own satellite for a location requiring geolocation.  

Most of my work is in an Ionic + Angular + Capacitor environment.  I can run a MEAN stack, I usually prefer to use a BaaS/PaaS with Firebase being my most common recommendation.

Many projects now have some need to integrate.  I'll often facilitate this with either an Express or Flask base running as a server-less API as a Cloud Function.  

With respect to native projects, I have implemented many of the tools from the Capacitor API including and not limited to components like geolocation, camera (either for uploads or for QR strategies) and items like push notifications.  

## Biggest Regrets or To-Do's

I built an end-to-end solution for water quality monitoring as an IoT solution.  We created a hardware API to control deep-level handling of the switching inside of a series of Analog Devices chips.  As I write this in 2022, let's be realistic about if we could manufacture really anything right now, but one of my biggest regrets is not carving out the time to have open-sourced this project to do good.
